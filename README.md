# **Titanic Survival Prediction**
This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning models.

# **Overview**
The Titanic dataset is analyzed to understand factors influencing survival rates among passengers. Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, LightGBM, and Neural Network are utilized for prediction.

# **Contents**
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and model training.
data/: Includes the Titanic dataset files (train.csv, test.csv).
requirements.txt: Lists necessary Python packages for running the code.

# **Contributions**
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

# **Credits**
This project is inspired by the Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition and various online tutorials.
